## Description
VITA2PC is a tool allowing to stream PSVITA/PSTV to your PC via WiFi.<br>
It currently supports audio streaming too however the feature is **highly experimental** and may cause several issues such as game freezes, mute audio on vita side, corrupted or distorted audio on PC side. It will also cause stuttering or worse framerate on some games depending on how audio is handled by the game itself.
